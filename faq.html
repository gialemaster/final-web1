		<p class="sub">Knitting can be pretty overwhelming, and there are a lot of common mistakes even experienced knitters can make!</p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="question">
	  <div class="q1">
		<h2 class="q">My knit stitches look more like Y's than V's, why is that?</h2>
		<p class="a">That would be because the stitches are twisted. Whether you're using a purl or knit stitch, you should always wrap your yarn around the needle counter clockwise.</p>
	  </div>

	  
		<div class="q1">
		  <h2 class="q">I just realized I dropped a stitch, do I have to start over now?</h2>
		  <p class="a">No! There's no need to start over, grab a crochet hook and pull the loops up through each row until you've reached your needle.</p>
		</div>
		
		
			<div class="q1">
			  <h2 class="q">I frogged my work, can I use the yarn again?</h2>
			  <p class="a">Of course! In most cases yarn can be used over and over and over again. Just make sure you wind all the loose yarn into a ball so it doesn't get tangled.</p>
			</div>
			
			
				<div class="q1">
				  <h2 class="q">I finished a project, now what?</h2>
				  <p class="a">Always make sure to block your project. This evens out the stitches and 'sets' the piece in place. After that, revel in your masterpiece!</p>
				</div>
				
				
					<div class="q1">
					  <h2 class="q">Where are the best places to buy yarn?</h2>
					  <p class="a">Yarn.com, Knitpicks.com, or your local yarn store. Ravelry.com even has a LYS locater. Hover over Advanced Search, then click on LYS and enter your location or postal code.</p>
					</div>
					
					
						<div class="q1">
						  <h2 class="q">How do I know how much yarn I need for a project?</h2>
						  <p class="a">On the first page of your pattern there will be a section indicating how many yards/meters/grams you need. Look on the label of your yarn and it will tell you length and weight in either ounces or grams. Always round up if you're in between a number of skeins.</p>
						</div>
						
						
							<div class="q1">
							  <h2 class="q">What do I do with all these loose ends?</h2>
							  <p class="a">The supplies needed to weave in your ends is just a tapestry needle. To weave them in seamlessly, duplicate stitch a few times and cut the excess yarn tail.</p>
							</div>
							
							
								<div class="q1">
								  <h2 class="q">My pattern is talking about 'gauge,' what is that?</h2>
								  <p class="a">Gauge refers to the amount of stitches and rows it takes to get a certain amount of inches. I always recommend doing a gauge swatch to make sure your piece will turn out the right size. A gauge swatch usually measures about 4 inches, and the pattern will indicate how many stitches to cast on.</p>
