        <h3 class="yarntitle">Wool</h3>  
        <p class="yarnex">Wool is the most insulating fiber on the planet, it is best used for sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, and socks. Wool is really the renaissance man of the knitting world. It will keep you warm while still being breathable.</p>
</div>
        <div class="yarninfo">
          <h3 class="yarntitle">Merino Wool</h3>
          <p class="yarnex">Merino wool is the highest form of wool. It is usually the softest and warmest fiber, but that comes with a hefty price tag.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="yarninfo">
            <h3 class="yarntitle">Sock Yarn</h3>
              <p class="yarnex">Sock yarn is- you guessed it, for socks! It's usually a wool/nylon blend with a ratio of around 80/20 or 85/15. It's blended with nylon to give the socks more durability since you're walking around on them they need to be sturdy.</p>
            </div>
              <div class="yarninfo">
                <h3 class="yarntitle">Mohair</h3>
<p class="yarnex">Mohair is yet another subset of wool, but it comes from the Angora goat instead of the sheep. It is silky and soft, and creates a halo around any piece made with this yarn because of the fluffy fibers. </p>
</div>
<div class="yarninfo">
  <h3 class="yarntitle">Cotton</h3>
    <p class="yarnex">Cotton yarn is very versatile, it's vegan which is appealing to some people, it can be used for anything from washclothes to purses. It's also great for knitting light flowy tank tops and tee shirts.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="yarninfo">
      <h3 class="yarntitle">Acrylic</h3>
        <p class="yarnex">Acrylic yarn is the most common yarn to find in a craft store. It can range from scratchy and rough to silky smooth, but it is made of plastic so if you're planning on a project that will come into contact with heat- check the melting point of your yarn!<p>

    <h1 class="head1">Yarn weight</h1>
    
    <p class="sub">Yarn weight determines the thickness of your yarn, its vital to understand this for reading patterns and pattern making.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="weight">
    <p class="usa">In the Unites States, most chain craft stores like Joann's or Michaels will have the yarn numbered; yarn stores online or indie yarn sellers will usually go by the name so it's important to get used to using both and being able to recall what the number and corresponding name is.The number system is 0 through 7, with 0 being the thinnest and 7 being the thickest. Weight 4, or Worsted yarn, is the most common but in most craft stores you will find a range of 3 and up.</p>
