    <h1 class="head1">Beginner Tutorials</h1>
    
    <p class="sub">This page is all about the very basics of knitting, from stitches to how to read a pattern.</p>
  </div>
<h2 class="basics">The Basics</h2>
<div class="tutcontainer">
<div class="tuts">
<h3 class="tuthead">The longtail cast-on</h3>
<p class="tutp">The longtail cast-on is a very versatile cast on technique, but it requires a bit of guessing. It makes a very stretchy foundation, but you need a long tail of yarn. The more stitches, the longer it must be.</p>
</div>
<div class="tuts">
<h3 class="tuthead">Cable cast-on</h3>
<p class="tutp">The cable cast-on is the opposite of the long tail cast-on. It is very sturdy and can be ideal when a stiff edge is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="tuts">
<h3 class="tuthead">The knit stitch</h3>
<p class="tutp">The knit stitch is the most basic stitch, and therefore the most important. It is used in Stocking stitch (sometimes called <i>stockinette</i>>and is the most commonly used stitch in knitting.</p>
</div>
<div class="tuts">
<h3 class="tuthead">The purl stitch</h3>
<p class="tutp">The second most common knit stitch, the purl (pronounced <i>"pearl"</i>) is the second technique used in Stocking stitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="tuts">
<h3 class="tuthead">Basic cast-off</h3>
<p class="tutp">The basic bind off is the cast-off equivalent of the cable cast-on. It's very sturdy and creates a nice clean edge.</p>
</div>
<div class="tuts">
<h3 class="tuthead">Stretchy cast-off</h3>
<p class="tutp">Like the basic cast-off, the stretchy cast off is the counterpart of the longtail cast-on. It's great for things like socks or sweater neck holes. </p>
